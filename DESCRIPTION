Description: Provided a protein UniProt AC code and an input file with scores for 
    each position of the protein sequence, this package will atempt to obtain all
    the PDB structures associated with the UniProt AC and replace the B-factor column
    with the scores from the input file. This will be done only for the PDB 
    chains that correspond to the UniProt AC.
    The folder ./out will have the ATOM and HETATM records for the modified PDB files
    (*_Bfact-score.pdb) and also from the original PDB files (*_original.pdb).
